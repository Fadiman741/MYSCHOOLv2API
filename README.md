MYSCHOOLAPI: Comprehensive Educational Platform API
Overview

The MYSCHOOLAPI is a robust Django REST Framework (DRF)-based API that powers an educational platform, integrating PostgreSQL for data storage and Cloudinary for media management. It facilitates grade-based subject discussions, social interactions (posts, comments, replies, likes), tutor discovery, and institution-specific content creation with rich media support.
Core Features & Implementation
1. User Roles & Authentication

The system supports four distinct user roles:

    Students – Can join grade-subject discussions, interact with posts, and search for tutors.

    Teachers – Can moderate discussions, create posts, and manage subject content.

    Tutors – Can offer tutoring services, be discovered via search, and engage in discussions.

    Institutions – Can publish articles with custom styling and media attachments.

Implementation Details

    User Model extends Django’s AbstractUser with role-based fields:
    python
    Copy

    class User(AbstractUser):
        ROLE_CHOICES = [
            ('student', 'Student'),
            ('teacher', 'Teacher'),
            ('tutor', 'Tutor'),
            ('institution', 'Institution'),
        ]
        role = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=ROLE_CHOICES)
        # Additional fields: profile_picture (Cloudinary), subjects, experience, etc.

    Token-based authentication (TokenAuthentication) ensures secure access.

    Permissions (IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser, custom permission classes) restrict actions based on roles.

2. Grade-Subject Management (Admin)

Admins can:

    Add grades (e.g., Grade 10, Grade 11).

    Assign subjects (e.g., Mathematics, Physics) to each grade.

    Each grade-subject pair acts as a discussion room.

Implementation Details

    Models:

    class Grade(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=50)  # e.g., "Grade 10"

    class Subject(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        grade = models.ForeignKey(Grade, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    Admin Interface:

        Django Admin or a custom DRF endpoint for CRUD operations.

        Only admins (IsAdminUser) can modify grades/subjects.

3. Discussion System (Posts, Comments, Replies, Likes)

Users can:

    Create posts in subject-specific rooms.

    Comment on posts.

    Reply to comments.

    Like posts, comments, or replies.

    Attach images/videos (via Cloudinary).

Implementation Details

    API Endpoints:

        POST /api/posts/ – Create a post.

        GET /api/posts/?subject_id=<id> – Fetch posts for a subject.

        POST /api/comments/ – Add a comment.

        POST /api/likes/ – Like a post/comment/reply.

4. Tutor Discovery System

Students can:

    Search tutors by subject, experience, or location.

    View tutor profiles (bio, ratings, availability).


5. Institution Articles (Rich Content)

Institutions can:

    Create articles with custom styling.

    Embed images/videos (Cloudinary integration).
